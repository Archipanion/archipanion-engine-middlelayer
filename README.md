# archipanion-engine-middlelayer
This project provides a middleware between the Archipanion frontend and the Vitrivr Engine backend.
Its main purpose is to:

 1. Provide logic that simplifies the query language of the vitrivr engine.
 2. Manage query templates and assign queries to a specific schema.
 3. Provide functionality for managing multiple schemas.

The following functionality is planned for future releases:

4. User based (oauth) and schema based (bearer) authentication will take place in this middleware.
5. Schema based routing to a Vitrivr Engine endpoint.

The documentation can be found on the wiki page [Middleware Documenttation](https://github.com/Archipanion/archipanion-engine-middlelayer/wiki)
